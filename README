BUILDING AND RUNNING

To get started, download and extract JFlex and CUP, and
set two environment variables to your locations of JFlex and CUP. For example:

  export JFLEX_DIR=$HOME/jflex-1.7.0
  export CUP_DIR=$HOME/cup

The simplest option is to just download and extract the same versions I'm using:
JFlex 1.7.0 (https://jflex.de/release/jflex-1.7.0.tar.gz) and
CUP 0.11b-20160615 (http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/releases/java-cup-bin-11b-20160615.tar.gz).

To build the lexer, parser, and interpreter:

  make

To run the interpreter:

  ./aurelius [OPTIONS] AURELIUS_PROGRAM INTEGER_ARG_TO_MAIN

Run without any arguments to see supported options.
